## Usage

ILDPerformance is part of a standard iLCSoft release, so you can use it directly after initializing iLCsoft, e.g.:

```sh
source /cvmfs/ilc.desy.de/sw/x86_64_gcc49_sl6/v01-19-05/init_ilcsoft.sh
```
In order to run most of the performance scripts it is however required to have your own *writable copy* of ILDPerformance.
For this you can either copy the one from `$ILCSOFT/ILDPerformance` or directly download the HEAD version from Github:

```sh
# download HEAD version from Github
git clone https://github.com/iLCSoft/ILDPerformance.git

cd ILDPerformance
```

If you want to build your own version of ILDPerformance you can use the usual iLCSoft build sequence (only needed if you want to
make changes to the C++ code or you know that you need a newer version than the one installed in iLCSoft):


```sh
# init iLCSoft, e.g:
source /cvmfs/ilc.desy.de/sw/x86_64_gcc49_sl6/v01-19-05/init_ilcsoft.sh

mkdir build ; cd build

# configure cmake
cmake -C $ILCSOFT/ILCSoft.cmake ..

# build the library
make -j 4 install

# make Marlin use this version of ILDPerformance
export MARLIN_DLL=$PWD/../lib/libILDPerformance.so
```

See the following section for documentation on how to run the various performance plots.
